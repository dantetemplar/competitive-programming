# Competitive Programming Setup

My competitive programming setup for contests, primarily from Codeforces.

## Features

- Scaffolding workflow in one click:
  - Test Cases right in your VSCode
  - Templated code for the contest
  - Submit button to submit your solution to Codeforces from VSCode
- PyPy 3.10 for JIT-compiled performance
- Optimized I/O for faster execution

## Setup

This project uses [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) for dependency management:

```bash
# Install uv if you don't have it
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh

# Install dependencies
uv sync
```

## Workflow

### Automated Contest Scaffolding

Use these extensions to automatically scaffold problem sets:

1. My version of **[Competitive Programming Helper](https://github.com/dantetemplar/fork-cph)** (VSCode)
   - Download VSIX from [Releases](https://github.com/dantetemplar/fork-cph/releases)
   - Install in VSCode
   - Set settings (CTRL+Shift+P -> "Preferences: Open Workspace Settings (JSON)"): 
    ```json
    {
      "cph.general.defaultLanguage": "python",
      "cph.general.saveLocation": "${group}/",
      "cph.general.menuChoices": "python",
      "cph.general.defaultLanguageTemplateFileLocation": "/home/USER/.../competitive-programming/_cph_template.py"
    }
    ```
    *Note: PR [#582](https://github.com/agrawal-d/cph/pull/582) submitted to upstream CPH repository.*

2. **[Competitive Companion](https://github.com/jmerle/competitive-companion#readme)** (Browser)
   - Install browser extension
   - Click extension logo on contest page
   - Files with test cases appear in your IDE

3. **[Codeforces Submit add-on for Competitive Programming Helper](https://github.com/agrawal-d/cph-submit)** (VSCode)
   - Install browser extension
   - In VSCode you will be able to click on the "Submit" button to submit your solution to Codeforces

This creates contest directories with templated files. See [_cph_template.py](_cph_template.py) for the default template.

**Running test cases:**
1. Open any problem file (e.g., `A_Problem_Name.py`)
2. Use keyboard shortcuts:
   - **`Ctrl+Alt+B`** - Run all test cases
3. View results in the CPH panel
4. You can also use the "Submit" button to submit your solution to Codeforces

The extension automatically runs your solution against all parsed test cases and shows pass/fail status with execution time.

### PyPy Usage

Solutions are run with **PyPy 3.10** for significant performance gains over CPython. PyPy's JIT compiler provides 2-5x speedup on typical competitive programming problems.

On Codeforces, submit using the "PyPy 3-64" language option.

### Optimized I/O


The template includes faster I/O functions to overcome Codeforces bottlenecks:

```python
import sys

def input():
    """25x faster input on 1,000,000 lines"""
    return sys.stdin.readline().strip()

def print(s, end="\n"):
    """2x faster output on 1,000,000 lines"""
    return sys.stdout.write(str(s) + end)
```

**Benchmark results:**
- Standard `input()`: 3.372s
- Optimized `input()`: 0.130s
